            <p class="p2">Then how could he have given you this?</p>
            <p class="p1">he cursed me</p>
            <p class="p2">He did what?</p>
            <p class="p1">he warned me something like this would happen</p>
            <p class="p2">Babe, what’re you talking about?</p>
            <p class="p1">it was an innocent thing. we did it as a joke</p>
            <p class="p2">Did what? I’m very confused.</p>
            <p class="p1">zach, this boy in our class performed a ritual on us so he could curse us</p>
            <p class="p2">Why??</p>
            <p class="p1">cause we made fun of him at lunch</p>
            <p class="p2">You did what?</p>
            <p class="p1">he was the outcast…sat by himself and we thought it would be fun to go sit by him</p>
            <p class="p2">How is that making fun of him?</p>
            <p class="p1">we would steal his stuff and say things to him, mean things</p>
            <p class="p2">Why did you do that?</p>
            <p class="p1">i didnt, i just sat at the table and watched the others do it</p>
            <p class="p1">it was mostly gabby and tori</p>
            <p class="p2">And you think he cursed you??</p>
            <p class="p1">thats what he told us. yesterday when we tried to do it again</p>
            <p class="p2">And this is why you’re sick??</p>
            <p class="p1">ya he told us yesterday that he went home and cursed us</p>
            <p class="p2">Witchcraft stuff??</p>
            <p class="p1">we didnt believe it either…said he set up ash circles and candles and such…</p>
            <p class="p1">had each of our names and hair…not sure how he got it</p>
            <p class="p2">But you didn’t bully him?</p>
            <p class="p1">we werent bullying him, we were just havin fun</p>
            <p class="p1">it was all a good laugh…we didnt mean to hurt him</p>
            <p class="p2">Well, sometimes babe, just sitting there and watching it happen is condoning it.</p>
            <p class="p1">ik ik</p>
            <p class="p1">i wanted to tell them to stop</p>
            <p class="p1">i would’ve if i would’ve known this would happen</p>
            <p class="p2">Babe, curses aren’t real. He couldn’t have caused this.</p>
            <p class="p1">i didnt believe it either</p>
            <p class="p2">It’s just a coincidence. You just have a bad fever and need rest.</p>
            <p class="p1">he told us an ancient plague would befall us</p>
            <p class="p2">He was just trying to scare you. And it worked.</p>
            <p class="p2">Did you get that rag?</p>
            <p class="p1">no</p>
            <p class="p2">Why not?</p>
