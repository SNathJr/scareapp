        <div class="chat">
            <p class="p1">Wake up!</p>
            <p class="p2">What the hell, it’s 3AM.</p>
            <p class="p1">You were having a bad dream.</p>
            <p class="p2">I know. I was there.</p>
            <p class="p1">It was really hurting my stomach.</p>
            <p class="p2">What? That doesn’t make any sense.</p>
            <p class="p2">Who is this? If this is a prank from Jimmy I’m not amused.</p>
            <p class="p1">I don’t know what a Jimmy is but I can assure you I am not that.</p>
            <p class="p1">I’m The Thing.</p>
            <p class="p2">?</p>
            <p class="p1">The Thing That Lives Underneath Your Bed.</p>
            <p class="p2">If that’s true, tap on the bed frame twice.</p>
            <p class="p2">I knew it! I knew you were real!</p>
            <p class="p2">You know my parents still laugh at me for using a nightlight.</p>
            <p class="p1">There’s really no need for that thing. It’s actually really irritatingly bright.</p>
            <p class="p2">It’s the brightest kind there is.</p>
            <p class="p1">I can tell. I don’t know how you sleep.</p>
            <p class="p1">If you could turn that off it would be great, then I could sleep better too.</p>
            <p class="p2">No way, not going to happen.</p>
            <p class="p1">Alright, we’ll save that for another night. But that’s not why I am texting you.</p>
            <p class="p2">How are you texting me? Where did you get a phone?</p>
            <p class="p1">You left one here a couple of weeks ago. I assumed it was for me so that I could talk with you.</p>
            <p class="p1">Although you could have made it a lot easier to unlock.</p>
            <p class="p2">That wasn’t meant for you! It fell off of my bed. My parents forced me to pay the replacement fee.</p>
            <p class="p1">Sorry. If I had money I’d reimburse you but all that’s down here are random clothes and a tennis racket.</p>
            <p class="p1">(But no ball sadly) 🙁</p>
            <p class="p1">Anyway, I’m texting you because your bad dreams are making me sick and slimy.</p>
            <p class="p1">It’s causing me to break out with bad acne and is giving my skin ugly boils.</p>
            <p class="p2">How can I have good dreams when you are down there tormenting me?</p>
            <p class="p1">I’m not tormenting you.</p>
            <p class="p2">What about all those gurgley slimy sounds?</p>
            <p class="p1">The bad dreams give me terrible indigestion.</p>
            <p class="p2">And the crunching sounds?</p>
            <p class="p1">All the bugs that live down here. I keep stepping on them.</p>
            <p class="p1">It’s actually really messy down here, like you haven’t cleaned for years. I’d hate to see the rest of your room.</p>
            <p class="p2">THERE ARE BUGS?</p>
            <p class="p1">Yeah ants, centipedes, spiders.</p>
            <p class="p2">WHAT THERE ARE SPIDERS UNDER MY BED?!?!</p>
            <p class="p1">A huge nest.</p>
            <p class="p2">OMG GET THEM AWAY.</p>
            <p class="p1">Don’t worry. I squish them before they can escape.</p>
            <p class="p1">I know most of your dreams involve spiders and me which, by the way, I don’t have thousands of tentacles and I certainly don’t eat human beings.</p>
            <p class="p1">But if I did have a thousand tentacles it would be a lot easier to prevent the bugs from escaping.</p>
            <p class="p2">You actually stop them from reaching me?</p>
            <p class="p1">Yes! I can’t afford to have you fall asleep scared. Any more bad dreams and I’ll probably die.</p>
            <p class="p2">How do I know you’re not just saying this to lure me into a false sense of security?</p>
            <p class="p1">There’s nothing for me to gain by scaring you.</p>
            <p class="p2">I’ve read Calvin and Hobbes. I know what terrible creatures you guys are.</p>
            <p class="p1">I swear to you that’s not how we are. That comic is very misleading and very mischaracterizing.</p>
            <p class="p2">Sureee then I take one step out of bed and you’ll pull me under and rip me to shreds.</p>
            <p class="p1">Look. I’m like a Dream Catcher of sorts. I live off of dreams.</p>
            <p class="p1">I don’t eat meat or even humans to be quite honest.</p>
            <p class="p1">Though I do like the concept of ice cream. I wouldn’t mind trying it one day.</p>
            <p class="p2">Okay, so assuming you do live off of dreams, what am I supposed to do about it?</p>
            <p class="p1">Stop having bad ones. If you have good dreams then I will feel better.</p>
            <p class="p1">No more slime, no more boils. Maybe I’ll even lose some weight!</p>
            <p class="p1">I promise you there is nothing to fear.</p>
            <p class="p1">Except maybe my cousin, the Thing That Lives Inside Your Closet.</p>
            <p class="p2">WHAT!?!</p>
            <p class="p1">Kidding, kidding. Bad joke. I promise.</p>
            <p class="p1">But seriously, if you keep having bad dreams I will probably die.</p>
            <p class="p2">I don’t know if I can force myself to have good dreams.</p>
            <p class="p1">Think of it this way: I’m not some evil creature living under your bed.</p>
            <p class="p1">AND – I’m protecting you from the spiders and other bugs.</p>
            <p class="p1">As long as I am around the things you fear most won’t harm you.</p>
            <p class="p2">I guess. But I still don’t trust you.</p>
            <p class="p1">That’s alright, just believe me.</p>
            <p class="p2">Okay, but can I sleep now? I have to wake up in a couple of hours.</p>
            <p class="p1">Alright, fine. We can talk about this again later.</p>
            <p class="p1">Sweet dreams. 🙂</p>
