            <p class="p1">Well, not to this extent…</p>
            <p class="p1">I don’t think.</p>
            <p class="p1">Or you’re my doppelganger</p>

            <p class="p1">Are you adopted?</p>
            <p class="p2">No…</p>
            <p class="p1">Oh ok, cause I am…</p>
            <p class="p1">So I thought, maybe…</p>
            <p class="p2">yeah, I can see why you thought that, but sorry</p>
            <p class="p1">Of course, no worries.</p>

            <p class="p1">Yeah, one sister and you?</p>
            <p class="p2">Nope, only child</p>
            <p class="p1">I see</p>
            <p class="p1">I got adopted and my parents adopted another girl, my sister</p>
            <p class="p1">they couldn’t have kids…</p>
            <p class="p2">yeah, makes sense</p>
            <p class="p2">You know about your biological parents?</p>
            <p class="p1">No, nothing…I just know I was given birth anonymously…</p>
            <p class="p1">Guess they could not have me you know</p>
            <p class="p2">sorry</p>
            <p class="p1">hey, don’t be, got a great family.</p>
            <p class="p2">I’m glad.</p>
            <p class="p2">Where do you live?</p>
            <p class="p1">In Tampa</p>
            <p class="p2">OMG, Florida too?</p>
            <p class="p2">I live in Lakeland, not far</p>
            <p class="p2">We should meet one day and take a picture, could be fun</p>
            <p class="p1">Yep! for sure!</p>
            <p class="p2">I can’t help but stare at the pictures of you</p>
            <p class="p2">It’s so so strange</p>
            <p class="p1">I know, got the same feeling</p>
            <p class="p1">Your hair has a lot of blonde in it, tho?</p>
            <p class="p2">I have to admit, I cheat a bit…</p>
            <p class="p1">Haha</p>
            <p class="p2">You seem taller</p>
            <p class="p1">I’m 5’6</p>
            <p class="p2">same</p>
            <p class="p1">Let’s remain lady like and not share our weight</p>
            <p class="p2">Haha, agreed</p>
            <p class="p1">Let’s see, what else</p>
            <p class="p2">I don’t know… How old are you?</p>
            <p class="p1">16, just got my license!</p>
            <p class="p2">Same! well, don’t have my license yet but soon.</p>
            <p class="p2">Or so I hope</p>
            <p class="p1">Yeah, I mean I got it pretty early on, only turned 16 two month ago</p>
            <p class="p2">What date?</p>
            <p class="p1">17 september</p>
            <p class="p2">Is this a joke?</p>
            <p class="p1">What?</p>
            <p class="p2">Did you see that on my facebook?</p>
            <p class="p1">see what? your age??</p>
            <p class="p1">It’s not on your facebook</p>
            <p class="p2">My birthday is also 17th of September</p>
            <p class="p1">Are you for real?</p>
            <p class="p2">It can’t be…</p>
            <p class="p2">That’s too much of a coincidence</p>
            <p class="p1">Where were you born?</p>
            <p class="p2">Saint Vincent hospital</p>
            <p class="p1">Me too</p>
            <p class="p1">I feel like the parent’s trap moment with the pictures…</p>
            <p class="p2">No, but how?</p>
            <p class="p2">I’m not adopted!</p>
            <p class="p1">Maybe your parents didn’t want to tell you</p>
            <p class="p2">But why?</p>
            <p class="p2">That would be so unfair!</p>
            <p class="p1">But at this point, everything seems to indicate that we’re sisters…</p>
            <p class="p2">Oh my god</p>
            <p class="p1">I don’t know if I should be happy or mad. it’s so confusing</p>
            <p class="p1">I’m happy</p>
            <p class="p2">this really isn’t a joke?</p>
            <p class="p1">No, I swear.</p>
            <p class="p1">Why would I make a joke like that??</p>
            <p class="p2">Yeah, sorry.</p>
            <p class="p2">I need to talk to my parents.</p>
            <p class="p2">I’ll let you know of course, and we’ll meet soon.</p>
            <p class="p1">I mean, there’s another possibility…</p>
            <p class="p2">What is it?</p>
            <p class="p1">Maybe your parents only wanted one kid…</p>
            <p class="p2">What??</p>
            <p class="p1">Maybe your parents did not adopt you</p>
            <p class="p1">Maybe they are your biological parents…</p>
            <p class="p2">So maybe they’re yours, too??</p>
            <p class="p1">Maybe</p>
            <p class="p2">let me add your contact</p>
            <p class="p2">Done</p>
            <p class="p3">Did you talk to them?</p>
            <p class="p2">Well I was about to but then I though about you</p>
            <p class="p2">I want to believe you but….</p>
            <p class="p2">you could have just photoshopped my face and created a fake profile</p>
            <p class="p3">Strange…would need a lot of efforts and fake friends</p>
            <p class="p3">but yes I guess I could have</p>
            <p class="p3">what kind of proof do you want then?</p>
            <p class="p2">would you send me a selfie like now</p>
            <p class="p3">yes sure</p>
            <p class="p3"><img src="selfie1.png" alt="selfie1.png" height="190" width="240"></p>
            <p class="p3">so beautiful haha</p>
            <p class="p3">could you send me one too?</p>
            <p class="p2"><img src="selfie2.png" alt="selfie2.png" height="190" width="240"></p>
            <p class="p2">I guess that sttles it…</p>
            <p class="p3">wait…you used a filter cheater</p>
            <p class="p2">haha maybe</p>
            <p class="p2">it’s so weird though</p>
            <p class="p3">I know I don’t know if I should tell my parents</p>
            <p class="p3">I guess they could freak out</p>
            <p class="p2">why?</p>
            <p class="p3">well if your parents are mine they could be scared to lose me I think…</p>
            <p class="p2">we’re not there yet maybe my parents did’t tell me I was adopted</p>
            <p class="p2">I’m going to go talk to them now maybe you can talk to your parents after</p>
            <p class="p3">yeah sounds right</p>
            <p class="p3">good luck</p>
            <p class="p2">I’m so nervous</p>
            <p class="p2">brb</p>
            <p class="p3">Ok</p>
            <p class="p">an hour later</p>
            <p class="p2">OK I’m back</p>
            <p class="p2">So???what happened??</p>
            <p class="p2">it was so so weird</p>
            <p class="p2">My mom asked me to see pictures of you</p>
            <p class="p2">And then she started freaking out like I don’t know</p>
            <p class="p2">She was asking me all those questions about you….</p>
            <p class="p2">like where you lived and with who and all of that…</p>
            <p class="p2">half of which I couldn’t answer…</p>
            <p class="p3">Did you ask if you were adopted?</p>
            <p class="p2">Yeah she said I wasn’t</p>
            <p class="p2">My father was freaking out too,like he had no idea what I was talking about</p>
            <p class="p2">He kept saying its not possible</p>
            <p class="p3">I’m starting to freak out too! what could it be?</p>
            <p class="p2">I don’t know they said I should leave them alone</p>
            <p class="p2">I think they’re arguing,I can hear screaming and cries I don’t know</p>
            <p class="p2">I think someone lied</p>
            <p class="p2">I hear words like liar and not possible</p>
            <p class="p3">Wow Rough</p>
            <p class="p3">I’m sorry</p>
            <p class="p2">yeah they never fight</p>
            <p class="p2">I think we’ve uncovered something pretty big</p>
            <p class="p3">Urgh the suspense is killing me</p>
            <p class="p2">I know, me too</p>
            <p class="p3">Do you think they didn’t know they were ecpecting twins?</p>
            <p class="p3">Like the hospital made a mistake?</p>
            <p class="p2">I don’t’ know seems rather strange…</p>
            <p class="p2">Like a movie plot or something</p>
            <p class="p3">That would be super messed up</p>
            <p class="p2">Yeah cause that mean your adoption was like illegal</p>
            <p class="p3">What?</p>
            <p class="p2">well I’m not laywer but it would mean that you belong with us…</p>
            <p class="p2">if the didn’t give consent</p>
            <p class="p3">Well let’s not speculate we have no clue what happened yet</p>
            <p class="p3">And I guess they would be calling the police now if it were the case no?</p>
            <p class="p2">yeah</p>
            <p class="p3">Are they?</p>
            <p class="p2">No I don’t think so</p>
            <p class="p2">But I think we know for a fact we’re sisters right?</p>
            <p class="p3">if they said you weren’t adopted yes… I guess</p>
            <p class="p3">I don’t see any other explanation</p>
            <p class="p2">it’s strange but really wish you were here with me right now</p>
            <p class="p3">I feel the same</p>
            <p class="p2">My mom asked me questions like if you were happy and healthy and stuff like that…</p>
            <p class="p3">and your dad?</p>
            <p class="p2">I don’t know he was just like stunned</p>
            <p class="p2">he said he didn’t understand what was going on</p>
            <p class="p3">This is so so strange</p>
            <p class="p2">Hold on my mom is knocking on m door</p>
            <p class="p2">She just came in she’s crying</p>
            <p class="p2">She asked me to stop texting but I said I was talking to you</p>
            <p class="p2">she says hi</p>
            <p class="p3">??hi back,I guess</p>
            <p class="p2">ok she needs to talk to me</p>
            <p class="p2">she says she’s going to tell me the truth</p>
            <p class="p2">She’s ok with being part of the conversation…</p>
            <p class="p2">I know it’s weird but I kind of want you with me at this moment…</p>
            <p class="p2">do you want me to call you so you can hear it too?</p>
            <p class="p3">text please I think I’m too uncomfortable to speak…</p>
            <p class="p3">but yeah I want to hear it as you hear too…</p>
            <p class="p3">If it’s not too weird.. i’d rather know at the same time why we were separate…</p>
            <p class="p2">Ok I can text you what she says because you deserve to know</p>
            <p class="p2">And if you have any questions just ask</p>
            <p class="p2">(I’m writing what she is saying)</p>
            <p class="p2">I guess this is it…</p>
            <p class="p2">here it goes…</p>
            <p class="p2">You still there?</p>
            <p class="p3">Yeah sure</p>
            <p class="p2">ok so ready to learn the truth?</p>
            <p class="p3">I guess</p>
            <p class="p2">(she’s crying,it’s freaking me out)</p>
            <p class="p2">so she is saying she got pregnant whenn she was 22</p>
            <p class="p2">(that I knew)</p>
            <p class="p2">she never wanted me to find out like this</p>
            <p class="p3">Find out what?</p>
            <p class="p2">I don’t kow she is sobbing</p>
            <p class="p2">But apparently she didn’t know she was pregnat until the last moment</p>
            <p class="p2">she really did’t know and had stomach aches and went to the hospital</p>
            <p class="p2">that’s how she found out</p>
            <p class="p2">like when she was actually giving birth</p>
            <p class="p3">what?</p>
            <p class="p3">how is that possible?</p>
            <p class="p2">Apparently it’s very rare</p>
            <p class="p2">it’s called denial of pregnancy</p>
            <p class="p2">so she goes to the hospital and lears she’s going to give birth</p>
            <p class="p2">She was so shocked she didn’t know what to do….</p>
            <p class="p3">yeah I can imagine</p>
            <p class="p2">and she’s alone there doesn’t know who to call</p>
            <p class="p2">or how to explain</p>
            <p class="p2">As she’s done giving birth the doctors are like don’t move</p>
            <p class="p2">there’s another one coming…</p>
            <p class="p3">Me or You?</p>
            <p class="p2">She says me</p>
            <p class="p2">and so something is going wrong like one of the baby is sick</p>
            <p class="p2">Apparently me I ‘m like too weak or something</p>
            <p class="p2">I have an infection because of lack of prenatal care</p>
            <p class="p2">And so the doctors take me away…</p>
            <p class="p3">OMG did you know that?</p>
            <p class="p2">no</p>
            <p class="p2">She’s crying so hard I really don’t know what to say</p>
            <p class="p2">Anyways she keeps telliing the story</p>
            <p class="p2">So she’s like I can’t raise children I’m too young I had no idea…</p>
            <p class="p2">and she doesn’t know what to do she’s ashamed</p>
            <p class="p2">So she wants to give us up for adoption</p>
            <p class="p2">Chance of better life</p>
            <p class="p3">OMG</p>
            <p class="p3">This is so intense</p>
            <p class="p2">Yeah I know</p>
            <p class="p2">But o apparently the woman at like social services or something…</p>
            <p class="p2">well she tells her that because I’m sick and it might not resolve….</p>
            <p class="p2">it will be hard to be adopted for me</p>
            <p class="p3">Yeah I heard</p>
            <p class="p2">So after like struggling she decides she will keep me</p>
            <p class="p2">She says it was the hardest decision she ever made</p>
            <p class="p2">Like she spent hours with you saying goodbye</p>
            <p class="p2">But knowing she could not offer you what you needed</p>
            <p class="p2">She didn’t even know how she would manage with a sick kid</p>
            <p class="p3">OMG I’m crying</p>
            <p class="p3">This is heartbreaking</p>
            <p class="p2">She’s saying she checked up on you to make sure you were with a good family</p>
            <p class="p2">She met your parents</p>
            <p class="p3">Whaaattt?</p>
            <p class="p2">How could they hide this from me?</p>
            <p class="p2">Same here how could she?</p>
            <p class="p3">But where was your father?</p>
            <p class="p3">or I’m sorry our father?</p>
            <p class="p2">Yeah iam asking</p>
            <p class="p2">wtfff</p>
            <p class="p3">What?</p>
            <p class="p2">He’s not</p>
            <p class="p2">Like my father is not my father</p>
            <p class="p2">She met him two months later</p>
            <p class="p2">And he raised me like his own</p>
            <p class="p3">But so when she met him two months later</p>
            <p class="p3">And knew everything would be ok why didn’t she get me ?</p>
            <p class="p2">Let me ask</p>
            <p class="p2">She says she wanted to but she couldn’t</p>
            <p class="p2">there’s a 30 days time window to change your mmind after it’s done</p>
            <p class="p2">So it was too late</p>
            <p class="p2">And she never told my (adoptive) father</p>
            <p class="p3">This is insane</p>
            <p class="p3">Too much information I think</p>
            <p class="p2">yeah I know</p>
            <p class="p2">I hate her as much as I pity her right now</p>
            <p class="p3">Don’t hate her I don’t</p>
            <p class="p3">I can understand</p>
            <p class="p2">she lied to me my whole life</p>
            <p class="p3">So wait are you sick?</p>
            <p class="p2">No apparently the infection resolved itself without long term damages</p>
            <p class="p2">God I feel so betrayed</p>
            <p class="p3">Yeah I know.Me too</p>
            <p class="p2">Yeah but your parents lied to protect you</p>
            <p class="p2">like they thought she didn’t want you</p>
            <p class="p3">I think she lied to protect you too</p>
            <p class="p2">What if we had never found out about each other?</p>
            <p class="p3">Yeah… well we’ll never know…</p>
            <p class="p2">She is saying she’s a horrible person and how much she hates herself</p>
            <p class="p3">I think you should give her a hug and comfort her</p>
            <p class="p3">I know and you will talk and talk about it and it will take time</p>
            <p class="p3">But right now I think you should be there for her</p>
            <p class="p3">I’m sure she’s been there for your entire life</p>
            <p class="p2">How are you not mad about this? She gave you up</p>
            <p class="p3">I always knew my mother gave me up and I forgave her long time ago…</p>
            <p class="p3">Now I know she regrets it and I have a twin sister</p>
            <p class="p3">Trying to look at the bright side</p>
            <p class="p2">Yeah…God you’re so much mature than I am</p>
            <p class="p2">Guess you’re right</p>
            <p class="p3">How about we meet soon to talk about all of this?</p>
            <p class="p2">Yeah!I can’t wait</p>
            <p class="p2">Just the two of us at first right?</p>
            <p class="p3">Yes we should let it sink in</p>
            <p class="p2">She says she loves you</p>
            <p class="p2">I’m sorry it’s awkward…</p>
            <p class="p3">Yeah well we’ll all meet up soon</p>
            <p class="p3">We can become a very original family haha</p>
            <p class="p2">I like that…</p>
            <p class="p2">Plus we have a father to find</p>
