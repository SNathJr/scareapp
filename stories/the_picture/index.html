            <p class="p1">Hey honey.</p>
            <p class="p2">Hey mom.</p>
            <p class="p1">Busy studying?</p>
            <p class="p2">No. Just got back from a flea market with some friends.</p>
            <p class="p2">I almost bought this painting but I decided it was too much.</p>
            <p class="p1">What was he asking?</p>
            <p class="p2">Like $100.</p>
            <p class="p1">What was it of?</p>
            <p class="p2">It was like a family from the 1800’s. All dressed up. A mother and two little girls.</p>
            <p class="p1">Did it say who painted it?</p>
            <p class="p2">Can’t remember. Anyway. I decided not to buy it.</p>
            <p class="p1">Did you get the care package I sent?</p>
            <p class="p2">Yes. Thanks for the cookies!</p>
            <p class="p1">Just a little taste of home while you’re at school.</p>
            <p class="p2">Speaking of. I should probably do some studying. I got a C on my last Logic test.</p>
            <p class="p1">Ok. Just hold tight. You can do it.</p>
            <p class="p2">I will. Love you.</p>
            <p class="p1">I love you too.</p>
            <p class="p2">Mom.</p>
            <p class="p2">Guess what?</p>
            <p class="p1">What?</p>
            <p class="p2">I got the painting!</p>
            <p class="p1">What painting?</p>
            <p class="p2">The one from the flea market.</p>
            <p class="p2">I just couldn’t stop thinking about it.</p>
            <p class="p2">So I went back to buy it.</p>
            <p class="p1">That’s great. How much was it?</p>
            <p class="p2">FREE!!!</p>
            <p class="p2">I asked the guy how much and he said it wasn’t for sale.</p>
            <p class="p2">Then when I was leaving I found it near a dumpster.</p>
            <p class="p2">Can u believe it? Somebody must have bought it and decided they didn’t want it.</p>
            <p class="p1">Weird.</p>
            <p class="p2">I’ll send you a picture of it.</p>
            <p class="p1">Margaret. I think I know why someone got rid of it…</p>
            <p class="p2">Why?</p>
            <p class="p1">This isn’t a painting. It’s a photo.</p>
            <p class="p1">And everyone in it is dead.</p>
            <p class="p2">What? No they’re not.</p>
            <p class="p1">People use to do that. Take pictures of of dead relatives to preserve their memory.</p>
            <p class="p2">I don’t know what ur talking about! All these people are happy and smiling.</p>
            <p class="p1">No, they’re not honey. Look at them. They’re posed.</p>
            <p class="p2">I don’t know why you have to ruin this for me.</p>
            <p class="p1">I just think it’s weird to have it in your dorm room.</p>
            <p class="p2">It reminds me of home.</p>
            <p class="p1">WHY?</p>
            <p class="p2">The mom looks like you.</p>
            <p class="p1">Don’t say that.</p>
            <p class="p2">Why not?</p>
            <p class="p1">I think you should get rid of it.</p>
            <p class="p2">If I want to hang it in my room I will.</p>
            <p class="p1">Ok.</p>
            <p class="p1">But I don’t like it.</p>
            <p class="p2">Whatever, Mom. I gotta go.</p>
            <p class="p1">I love you.</p>
            <p class="p1">Margaret.</p>
            <p class="p1">Are you there?</p>
            <p class="p1">You won’t answer my calls.</p>
            <p class="p2">Hi.</p>
            <p class="p1">Is your phone off?</p>
            <p class="p2">Sorry. I must have missed them.</p>
            <p class="p1">I got a call from the college today.</p>
            <p class="p1">They said you haven’t been attending classes.</p>
            <p class="p2">I was sick.</p>
            <p class="p1">They said you haven’t been attending for the last month.</p>
            <p class="p2">I don’t want to go.</p>
            <p class="p1">Why not???</p>
            <p class="p2">I don’t know. I want to stay here.</p>
            <p class="p2">With the picture.</p>
            <p class="p1">The PICTURE???</p>
            <p class="p2">She talks to me.</p>
            <p class="p1">Who?</p>
            <p class="p1">Who talks to you??</p>
            <p class="p2">The lady in the picture.</p>
            <p class="p2">She wants me to come inside and join her.</p>
            <p class="p2">The little girls are really nice too.</p>
            <p class="p1">Margaret.</p>
            <p class="p1">I want you to go to the health center, ok?</p>
            <p class="p1">RIGHT NOW.</p>
            <p class="p1">I’ll be there in a few hours.</p>
            <p class="p1">Will you go to the health center for me?</p>
            <p class="p2">I feel fine!</p>
            <p class="p1">But you said you’ve been feeling sick. Maybe you should have a check up.</p>
            <p class="p2">Ok.</p>
            <p class="p1">Wait there. I’ll be there soon. Just hold tight!</p>
            <p class="p1">I love you.</p>
            <p class="p2">Love you too.</p>
            <p class="p1">MARGARET!</p>
            <p class="p1">You weren’t there!</p>
            <p class="p1">I’m coming to your room.</p>
            <p class="p1">Margaret.</p>
            <p class="p1">WHERE R U???</p>
            <p class="p1">MARGARET!!!</p>
            <p class="p2">I’m here, Mom.</p>
            <p class="p1">Where? There’s no one here.</p>
            <p class="p2">Come to the picture.</p>
            <p class="p2">Do u see me?</p>
            <p class="p1">Margaret?</p>
            <p class="p1">I thought you said there were only two little girls…</p>
            <p class="p2">I did. Now there are three. Don’t you recognize me?</p>
            <p class="p1">MARGARET. Come out of there!</p>
            <p class="p2">I can’t.</p>
            <p class="p2">I’m a part of the picture now.</p>
            <p class="p2">The lady says you can join us too.</p>
            <p class="p2">If you want…</p>
            <p class="p1">What?</p>
            <p class="p2">U can join us too if you want.</p>
            <p class="p2">We’re all a part of the picture.</p>
            <p class="p1">Margaret. WHY?</p>
            <p class="p2">We never die in here.</p>
            <p class="p2">The girls love to play hide n’ seek. They’re gone now, see?</p>
            <p class="p1">I don’t understand.</p>
            <p class="p2">The lady isn’t a very good mother though. She drowned the two little girls when her husband left her. We could use a good mother like you.</p>
            <p class="p2">Will you join us, Mom? Please?</p>
            <p class="p2">I love you. I miss you so much.</p>
            <p class="p2">Please, Mom?</p>
            <p class="p2">Please?</p>
            <p class="p1">If that’s what you want.</p>
            <p class="p2">Nothing would make me happier, Mommy.</p>
            <p class="p1">Ok, honey.</p>
            <p class="p1">I’m coming.</p>
            <p class="p1">Hold tight.</p>
